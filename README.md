# My Vim Settings

This repository contains my personal Vim settings, including my .vimrc configuration file and any additional plugins or customizations I use.
Installation

To use my Vim settings, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    shell

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

Copy the .vimrc file to your home directory:

shell

cp your-repo/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

If you have a Vim plugin manager installed (e.g., Vim-Plug, Vundle), install the plugins defined in the .vimrc file by running the appropriate command for your plugin manager. For example, with Vim-Plug:

shell

    vim +PlugInstall +qall

    Launch Vim, and the settings and plugins should be applied.

Customizations

Here are some of the customizations and features included in my Vim settings:

    Syntax highlighting enabled
    Auto-indentation for code files
    Line numbers displayed
    Smart search enabled (ignores case unless using capital letters)
    Code folding enabled (using the marker method)
    ALE plugin installed for linting and code analysis
    PaperColor color scheme applied

Feel free to explore the .vimrc file to see more details about the specific settings and plugins I've configured.
